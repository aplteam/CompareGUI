# CompareGUI

CGUI for the Comparison class designed to compare Dyalog APL objects.

CompareGUI is a workspace that contains the code needed by the `]CompareWorkpaces` user command.

It offers a GUI with a list of all objects only contained in the first or only contained in the second workspace, and a list of all objects that exist in both workspaces but are different. Those can be compared from the list one-by-one.
